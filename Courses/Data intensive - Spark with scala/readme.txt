Basic Level and all Extra Tasks are implemented in this assignment.

The "Flick.scala" file is containing the method which implements Elbow method and it returns the value of
error rates for each number of kernel(cenetr). For checking the value of new centers(new values of 
Longitudes and Latitudes), there is another file named "Code_Flickr3D.txt"; By runing this file the output
would be a csv file containg new values for kernels(centers).

Error rates are calculated by getting average in 100 different iterations while applying Elbow method.
This provides us to get a better result as can be seen in the report file of Elbow method.
